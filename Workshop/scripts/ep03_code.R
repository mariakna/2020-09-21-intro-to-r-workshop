# Challenge 1
# Using pipes, subset the ```surveys``` data to include animals collected before 1995 and

# Suggested Answers:
surveys_1995 <- surveys %>%

  # Ordering your columns does matter
  select(year, sex, weight)

# there are no ```NA```s and all values are less than 3.

# Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------
# 1. Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows,
#	and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping,
#	and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data.
#	Itâ€™s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.
surveys_spread_genera <- surveys %>% 
  group_by(plot_id, year) %>% 
  summarise(n_genera = n_distinct(genus)) %>% 
  spread(year, n_genera)

head(surveys_spread_genera)


# 2. Now take that data frame and gather() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.
surveys_spread_genera2 <- surveys_spread_genera %>% 
  gather(key = year, value = n_genera, -plot_id)

# 3. The surveys data set has two measurement columns: hindfoot_length and weight.
#	This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each
#	measurement per year in different plot types. Let's walk through a common solution for this type of problem.
#	First, use gather() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that
#	takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight.
#	Hint: You'll need to specify which columns are being pivoted.

surveys_long <- surveys %>% 
  gather("measurement", "value", hindfoot_length, weight)



# 4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type.
#	Then spread() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight.
#	Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for spread().


surveys_long2 <- surveys_long %>% 
  group_by(year, measurement, plot_type) %>%
